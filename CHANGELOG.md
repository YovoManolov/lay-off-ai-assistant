# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.3.3] - 2026-09-11

### Added
- **`docs/aws-deployment-process.md`** — the AWS deployment runbook for hosting the
  assistant (CloudFormation-templated IAM user + budget alert, Amplify frontend,
  Lambda/API Gateway backend on Bedrock). Split into three phases so the account owner
  never touches IAM or permissions and the engineer never sees the payment method or
  root credentials. Written in Bulgarian because Phase 1 is a click-by-click script for
  the non-technical account owner. Lives in `docs/`, not `knowledge-base/`, so it stays
  out of the agent's grounding.
- **Terraform variant for Phase 2, in the same document.** The Amplify frontend and the
  Lambda / API Gateway backend can be raised with Terraform instead of by hand, plus the
  four Phase 0 template additions that make it possible (named application roles +
  `iam:PassRole`, self-scoped `iam:CreateAccessKey`, an optional state bucket). Phase 1
  is explicitly unchanged — the account owner still clicks the link and sends the same
  three lines. Records what stays outside Terraform: the Phase 0 resources stay
  CloudFormation-owned (no `terraform import` — a `destroy` would take out the
  engineer's own access and the budget alert), and Bedrock model access remains a
  one-time console step.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-09-10

### Added
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md` "Proposing a change" section.** Contributors should not commit
  straight to `main`: either branch off `main` and open a pull request (the GitHub
  equivalent of a merge request), or — if not ready to write the change — just open an
  issue.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed
- **Verified two stale rows in `knowledge-base/bg-legal.md` via `freshness-checker`.**
  - **чл. 222, ал. 1 КТ (severance):** replaced the vague "ориентир 1 бруто (+ възможен
    период)" with the exact statutory wording (брутно трудово възнаграждение за времето
    без работа, но не повече от 1 месец; по-дълъг срок само ако е уговорен в КТД/ИТД),
    sourced against the consolidated Кодекс на труда on lex.bg. Row promoted from
    ⚠️ непроверено to ✅ потвърдено (2026-09-10). This статут-based fact sits outside the
    НАП/НОИ/АЗ mandate, so it is verified against the legal text itself.
  - **Преходен период (хартиена книжка):** the "до 1 юни 2026 г." transition had already
    elapsed, leaving the body speaking in future tense about past events. Rewrote the
    "Трудова книжка и електронен трудов запис" section into past/present tense (both stages
    now in force; paper books should already be returned — retrieve from employer if not;
    keep paper proof until retirement per НОИ). Row promoted to ✅ потвърдено (2026-09-10),
    sourced against НОИ + НАП Регистър на заетостта.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-09-08

### Changed
- **Rewrote the README for a first-time visitor.** It now leads with the full
  capability map — surfacing the BG benefits/legal clock and the fact-verification
  layer that were previously buried, so it no longer reads as a CV tool with extras —
  and adds a "How to use it" section: prerequisites, how to launch, a "what you can
  ask for" table of real phrases → outcomes, and what you get and where. The raw file
  tree is condensed to a short "How it works".

## [1.2.1] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed
- README's "uncoachable.work" link pointed at a relative repo path
  (`../uncoachable.work`), which GitHub resolved as a folder instead of the
  site. It now links to `https://uncoachable.work`.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-08

### Changed
- **Replaced the GitLab CI pipeline with a local pre-push test gate.** The
  server-side `.gitlab-ci.yml` job is gone; a version-controlled
  `.githooks/pre-push` hook now runs the full suite
  (`python -m unittest discover -s tests`) and aborts the push with a clear
  message if any test fails. Enable it once per clone with
  `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`. The hook is stdlib-only and probes for
  a working Python interpreter (so it survives Windows' non-functional
  `python3` Store stub). Documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md` under a new
  "Local test gate" section.
- **Doc recheck (Part A) fixes.** `README.md`: the "Status" section was stale
  ("Next: end-to-end testing") — refreshed to state the flow is shipped, stable,
  and enforced by the pre-push gate; the structure tree now lists the
  `freshness-checker` subagent that was missing from it. `tests/e2e/README.md`:
  reworded its "not part of CI" / "the 36 CI tests" references (there is no CI
  now, and the suite count had drifted) to point at the automated suite the
  pre-push gate runs.

### Removed
- **`.gitlab-ci.yml`** — superseded by the local pre-push gate above.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-09-08

### Changed
- **CLAUDE.md "Next steps" synced with reality.** Ticked and reworded the
  `company-intel` item (kept & fleshed out in v1.1.0 — given `Write`, writes its
  own dossier section) and removed the "publish the guide to the blog via the
  `uncoach-` pipeline" line as out of scope for this repo. The blog relationship
  stays documented in the Sibling-project note.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-07

### Changed
- **`company-intel` fleshed out and given `Write`.** The optional subagent now
  persists its own **Company intel** dossier section (fit read, "защо точно тук"
  angles, questions, flags) — one block per posting — which `interview-coach`
  picks up when the person moves to practice, instead of only "handing results
  via the dossier" it had no tool to write. Added a sourcing rule (cite company
  facts, flag recency) and a note that any market/benefit figure it surfaces is
  subject to the orchestrator's freshness gate, while qualitative company intel
  is its own to source. Kept lean and optional — it still overlaps
  `search-strategist`/`interview-coach` and must not grow into a second
  search-strategist.
- **Dossier template gains a "Company intel" section** (per-posting), the home
  for that written output, placed just before the Interviews section it feeds.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-07

### Changed
- **Documented the silent `.docx`/python-docx dependency.** The CV pipeline's
  `.docx` writer (the harness `docx` skill, with the `python-docx` package as
  fallback) is now stated as a dependency in `CONTRIBUTING.md`'s "Optional tooling"
  section — mirroring how LibreOffice is documented (what it's for, graceful
  behavior when absent) — and named inline in `cv-builder.md`'s render step so the
  dependency isn't implicit.
- **`bg-navigator` forbids guessed numeric ranges.** Sharpened its "never invent"
  rule to state explicitly that it must not emit approximate ranges or figures in
  prose (e.g. "8–9 мес."): deterministic values come only from `lib/benefits.py`,
  facts from `bg-legal.md`, and anything else is surfaced as
  "провери в НОИ/бюрото по труда" rather than estimated.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-07

### First stable release

The comeback assistant reaches 1.0.0: the full orchestrator → subagent flow works
end-to-end and is covered by an automated test suite.

- **Flow, end-to-end.** The orchestrator holds the relationship (triage + always-on
  support) and delegates bounded, produce-an-artifact work to subagents:
  `bg-navigator` (BG post-layoff logistics) gated by the independent
  `freshness-checker` (producer ≠ checker; stamps last-verified dates into
  `bg-legal.md`), a front-loaded `cv-builder` driving the `/tailor-cv` skill with
  LibreOffice PDF rendering, `search-strategist`, and `interview-coach`. The person
  only ever talks to the orchestrator.
- **Test coverage.** An automated suite backs the flow: a deterministic benefits
  calculator, static invariant checks, and an e2e smoke harness (checked-in
  "Мартин" fixture + stdlib artifact checker), validated on a real run — wired into
  GitLab CI.

Both 1.0.0 criteria in CLAUDE.md are met: the described flow (triage → subagents →
`freshness-checker` gate) works end-to-end **and** has tests covering it.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-09-07

### Changed
- **`knowledge-base/bg-legal.md` — чл. 222 КТ severance row stamped ⚠️.** The
  "Обезщетение по КТ при съкращение" row now records that severance under
  чл. 222, ал. 1 КТ falls **outside** НАП/НОИ/АЗ scope and is confirmed in writing
  by the employer, with a last-checked date. The status stays ⚠️ непроверено — no
  hard number is asserted as verified.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed
- **E2E checker false-failed the Cyrillic check on an English tailored CV.**
  `check_artifacts.py` passed only the tailored `.docx` to the Cyrillic check, and
  the cross-docx fallback was guarded by `len(docx_paths) > 1`, so a legitimately
  all-English tailored CV (Latin name, English role) read as "NO Cyrillic —
  possible mojibake" and the run exited 1. The check now scans the **full** CV
  `.docx` set and asserts "at least one CV `.docx` has Cyrillic" — the
  always-Bulgarian base CV carries the signal, an English tailored CV correctly has
  none, and only a run where **no** `.docx` has Cyrillic (a real garbled render)
  fails. Added `tests/test_e2e_checker.py` (stdlib `unittest`, synthetic `zipfile`
  `.docx`) to regression-proof it: English-tailored + Bulgarian-base passes,
  none-Cyrillic fails.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-05

### Added
- **End-to-end smoke harness (`tests/e2e/`)** — a repeatable Layer-B smoke test for
  the full flow (triage → subagents → `freshness-checker` gate → artifacts). The
  LLM run stays manual/on-demand; what is automated is the deterministic check:
  - **`tests/e2e/fixture_martin.md`** — the canonical, checked-in scenario: the
    "Мартин" persona (consistent ~9 г. осиг. стаж; съкратен 2026-08-14; ~3200 лв ≈
    1636 EUR; ПИК; base CV; target JD) and six scripted persona turns.
  - **`tests/e2e/check_artifacts.py`** — a stdlib-only artifact checker
    (`python tests/e2e/check_artifacts.py Personal/<date>-<slug>/`) that asserts the
    *shape* of a real run: dossier sections (derived from `dossier-template.md`), a
    tailored CV `.docx` + matching non-trivial `.pdf` under the `cv/` subtree,
    Cyrillic integrity read straight from `word/document.xml` via `zipfile` (no
    external dep; catches mojibake), an optional `pdftotext` PDF text check that
    skips cleanly when the tool is absent, and tracker zones/columns (derived from
    `templates/tracker.md`). Exits non-zero with a per-check report on failure.
  - **`tests/e2e/README.md`** — the runbook. On-demand only, **not** in CI: it needs
    a produced run folder, which lives under git-ignored `Personal/`. The checker is
    deliberately kept out of `unittest discover` (not named `test*.py`, guarded under
    `__main__`), so the existing 36-test suite is unaffected.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added
- **`tests/test_invariants.py` — a static repo-invariant test suite** (Layer A;
  stdlib `unittest`, no pytest) guarding the regressions this repo suffers
  *silently*:
  - **Tool/spec match** (the F1-class bug): for every `.claude/agents/*.md`,
    infer the tools its spec body requires (writes a file → `Write`; renders
    `.docx`/`.pdf` or calls python/soffice/a shell → `Bash`; runs a skill →
    `Skill`; web-searches/verifies or fetches a posting → `WebSearch`/`WebFetch`)
    and assert the frontmatter `tools:` covers them.
  - **Person data not tracked** — `git ls-files` is empty under `Personal/` and
    `work/`, and `.gitignore` ignores both.
  - **VERSION / tag / CHANGELOG agree** — VERSION is SemVer, matches the latest
    `vX.Y.Z` git tag (skips gracefully when tags aren't fetched), and has a
    CHANGELOG entry.
  - **Forbidden phrases** — the "не защото…, а защото" construction and
    "неудобен"/derivatives are absent from user-facing content
    (`knowledge-base/`, `agent/templates/`); the rule statements that *define*
    the bans are deliberately out of scope.
  - **Freshness gate wired** — `orchestrator.md` still routes through the
    `freshness-checker` gate.
  - **bg-legal ДНЕВНИК well-formed** — the "Дневник на проверките" table parses,
    every status is ✅/⚠️/❗, and every ✅ row cites a source and a date.
- **`.gitlab-ci.yml`** — a single `test` job on `python:3.12` running
  `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` on pushes to `main` and on merge
  requests. Stdlib only; no install step.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added
- **`lib/benefits.py` — a deterministic, stdlib-only benefits calculator** that moves the
  date/duration/money math out of LLM prose. Pure functions mirroring
  `knowledge-base/bg-legal.md` (cited inline, "keep in sync"):
  - `bureau_registration_deadline` — 7 **working** days after termination, excluding weekends
    and the official BG public holidays (incl. the movable Orthodox Easter and the чл. 154, ал. 2
    substitute Mondays). The 2026 holiday set is a clearly-marked per-year constant with an
    "update yearly" note, verified against official/reference sources (Easter 2026 = 12 Apr;
    МС one-off 2 Jan euro-adoption day).
  - `noi_declaration_deadline` — +3 calendar months, month-end clamped.
  - `benefit_duration_months` — чл. 54в КСО table with exact boundary handling.
  - `monthly_benefit_estimate` — 60% of the average осигурителен доход as a daily amount,
    clamped to [9.21, 54.78] EUR and capped at the 2300 EUR insurable income, × working days;
    `Decimal`, 2 dp.
  - A small CLI (`python -m lib.benefits …`) so `bg-navigator` can compute without prose math.
- **`tests/test_benefits.py`** — 25 stdlib `unittest` tests (run via `python -m unittest discover`):
  deadline cases spanning a weekend **and** a holiday, an already-missed case, every чл. 54в
  boundary (3y, 3y+1d, 7y, 7y+1d, 11y, 15y, 15y+1d), the estimate's normal/min/max-clamp cases,
  and a **drift test** that fails if `lib/benefits.py` and `bg-legal.md` disagree on the key
  constants (9.21, 54.78, 2300, the чл. 54в months).

### Changed
- **`bg-navigator` now computes via the helper** (added `Bash`) instead of doing date math in
  prose. Its spec makes the split explicit: `lib/benefits.py` is the calculator; `bg-legal.md`
  (verified by `freshness-checker`) is the source of truth for the constants; if they drift, the
  drift test fails. WebSearch still verifies the constants are current.
- `.gitignore`: ignore Python `__pycache__/` and bytecode.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-09-03

### Changed
- `knowledge-base/bg-legal.md`: the **чл. 54в КСО benefit-duration table** was independently
  verified against the official **НОИ** source (nssi.bg) and upgraded from ⚠️ непроверено to
  **✅ потвърдено**. All five осигурителен-стаж ranges confirmed unchanged:
  до 3 г. → 4 мес.; 3 г. 1 д – 7 г. → 6 мес.; 7 г. 1 д – 11 г. → 8 мес.;
  11 г. 1 д – 15 г. → 10 мес.; над 15 г. → 12 мес.
  - Дневник row generalized from the single 7–11 г. range to the whole table, re-dated
    2026-09-03, official URL = НОИ „при безработица" page; the "вербатим таблица не отворена"
    caveat removed.
  - Body duration line stamped as verified against НОИ; the live-check hedge softened to a
    general "провери при промени" note (no longer непроверено).
- **Electronic-record row** refresh confirmed consistent with the reform facts already in the
  file body: трудови правоотношения in force from 1 юни 2025 г., служебни from 1 юни 2026 г.
  (row re-dated 2026-09-01 by the freshness gate, still fresh; kept ✅).

## [0.1.8] - 2026-09-01

### Added
- **LibreOffice as the primary CV → PDF path.** The `/tailor-cv` render step and `cv-builder`
  step 3 now convert the rendered `.docx` to PDF via `soffice --headless --convert-to pdf`,
  chosen because it renders **Cyrillic (Bulgarian) reliably** — verified end-to-end
  (docx → PDF → extracted text round-trips Cyrillic, en-dashes, and `€`).
  - `.claude/skills/tailor-cv/SKILL.md`: Step 5 now spells out the LibreOffice export command
    (full `soffice.exe` path on Windows, which is not on `PATH`) and a clean no-LibreOffice
    fallback — deliver the `.docx` and let the person export the PDF themselves rather than
    shipping mojibake.
  - `.claude/agents/cv-builder.md`: step 3 points at the same primary path + fallback.
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md`: new "Optional tooling" section documenting the LibreOffice dependency,
    the Windows full-path quirk, the harmless startup warning, and the graceful degradation.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-08-29

### Changed
- CV gap-gathering is now **front-loaded to the orchestrator**. `cv-builder` runs headless and
  only the orchestrator talks to the person, so `/tailor-cv`'s one-question-at-a-time gap analysis
  can't reach them through the subagent. The orchestrator now collects the CV inputs up front (one
  question at a time, in its own voice), records them in the dossier's CV section, and hands
  `cv-builder` a complete brief.
  - `agent/orchestrator.md`: added a "CV brief (front-load before delegating to cv-builder)" step
    with a checklist derived from the skill's real inputs.
  - `.claude/agents/cv-builder.md`: now expects a complete brief and **does not interview** the
    person; residual gaps are returned to the orchestrator to ask one-at-a-time. The batched
    `CV_info_needed.md` is demoted to a last-resort fallback.
  - `.claude/skills/tailor-cv/SKILL.md`: one-line note that headless runs draw gap inputs from the
    orchestrator brief and surface residual gaps back instead of prompting.
  - `agent/dossier-template.md`: added a "CV бриф (front-load)" block to the CV section.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-08-29

### Fixed
- `bg-navigator` can now write the dossier (added `Write` tool) — its spec directs it to
  write the personalized checklist to the dossier's legal/benefits section.
- `cv-builder` can now render `.docx`/`.pdf` (added `Bash` tool) — the `/tailor-cv` render
  skills it wraps need a shell.
- Aligned both subagents' declared tools with their own specs (no spec rewrites).

## [0.1.5] - 2026-08-29

### Changed
- `knowledge-base/bg-legal.md` independently verified against NSSI (НОИ) for 2026, now in euro.
  - ✅ Confirmed against official sources: eurozone entry + EUR amounts and the fixed rate
    1 EUR = 1.95583 BGN (noi.bg); maximum insurable income **2300 EUR** from 01.08.2026
    (nssi.bg/dohod01082026); minimum/maximum daily unemployment benefit **9.21 / 54.78 EUR**
    for 2026 (official NSSI bulletin `unempl_02_2026.pdf`).
  - Fixed the source URL on the daily-benefit row (the figures live in the NSSI bulletin, not
    the dohod page) and re-stamped the two euro-figure rows to 2026-08-29.
  - ⚠️ Still unverified (kept непроверено): transitional paper-record period (до 1 юни 2026 г.)
    and the Labour Code severance orientation.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-08-28

### Added
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` (concise; points to `CLAUDE.md` for the full conventions).
- A "Contributing" pointer in `README.md`.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-08-28

### Added
- Dual licensing: MIT for the code, CC BY-NC 4.0 for the `knowledge-base/` content.
- Top-level `LICENSE` (MIT, with a dual-split header) and `knowledge-base/LICENSE` (full CC BY-NC 4.0 legal code).
- A "License" section in `README.md` explaining the split.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-08-28

### Added
- `CHANGELOG.md` in Keep a Changelog format, covering the 0.1.x history.

### Changed
- Versioning policy in `CLAUDE.md` now requires a changelog entry per release.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-28

### Changed
- Moved all per-person files under a git-ignored `Personal/<date>-<slug>/` root.
- Corrected the `CLAUDE.md` dev-commit convention and the person-data rule.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-27

### Added
- Full Bulgarian guide (`knowledge-base/guide.md`).
- Orchestrator + subagents architecture.
- Vendored `/tailor-cv` skill as the CV engine.
- `/comeback` entry-point skill (front door + per-person dossier bootstrap).
- `freshness-checker` verification gate for institutional facts.
- SemVer adoption and top-level `VERSION` file.
